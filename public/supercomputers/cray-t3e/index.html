  <h1>Cray T3E</h1>
  

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The Cray T3E is the successor of our Cray T3D
and is a massively parallel supercomputer, launched in 1995. In contrast to
our Cray T3D, we own a Cray T3E in a multi-cabinet air-cooled configuration
with up to 128 processing elements. Therefore it&rsquo;s a perfect supercomputer to
run and operate frequently without too complex infrastructure requirements,
except the high power consumption.</p>

<p>Since we have a bunch of cabinets we can even run two Cray T3E
installations! A small configuration with an acceptable power footprint for
regular operation, and a maximum configuration with 128 processors and 16
GBytes of main memory, of course.</p>

<p>The development of massively parallel supercomputers started very early at
Cray. Together with DEC they launched a project called Piranha and the first
results where named Wildfire and Marvel. That&rsquo;s why we named our two
supercomputers wildfire and marvel, too.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interessted in more details about the Cray T3E have a look at

<p>This supercomputer should be used as a primary development system for
massively parallel workloads. It consists of two cabinets with 32 processing
elements total. If your code is working fine you can request a schedule for
the larger 128 PEs configuration.</p>

<h3 id="marvel-gigaflops-net">marvel.gigaflops.net</h3>

<p>This supercomputer is the largest possible configuration of an air-cooled
Cray T3E. It consists of 6 cabinets and 128 processing elements total, with a
peak performance of 80.0 GigaFLOPS.</p>
