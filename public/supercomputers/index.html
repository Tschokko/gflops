        TL;DR The Cray T3E is the successor of our Cray T3D and is a massively parallel supercomputer, launched in 1995. In contrast to our Cray T3D, we own a Cray T3E in a multi-cabinet air-cooled configuration with up to 128 processing elements. Therefore it&rsquo;s a perfect supercomputer to run and operate frequently without too complex infrastructure requirements, except the high power consumption.
Since we have a bunch of cabinets we can even run two Cray T3E installations!
