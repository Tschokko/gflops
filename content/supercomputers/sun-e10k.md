: Sun Ultra Enterprise 10000, Sun Solaris 10, 51.2 GigaFLOPS peak performance

## TL;DR

During the dot-com boom period the Sun Ultra Enterprise 10000 (also known
as E10k) was one of the most popular supercomputers of the world. It's the
successor of the [Cray Superserver 6400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_CS6400),
but Cray Research was acquired by Silicon Graphics and
this division of supercomputers was than sold to Sun. Sun launched the
successor, code-name Starfire, as the Ultra Enterprise 10000 in 1997.

This supercomputer is in contrast to the usual supercomputers e.g. by Cray a
general-purpose / business system. Beside typical high-performance computing tasks, this
system was often used as an application or database server, too. The
partitioning feature of the Sun Ultra Enterprise 10000 enabled this system
even to be split into multiple logical servers for certain functions. Due
it's versatile usage the Sun Ultra Enterprise 10000 was present in nearly
every area, where lot's of computing power for different kind of applications was required.

Because of it's broad usage in several ares, this system is a must have
supercomputer in every supercomputer collection.
